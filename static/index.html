                an exact location to send our driver.

                This is unfortunate, but the driver has canceled this request,
                typically because they can't find you.

                You might want to resubmit your request quickly, since if the 
                driver is in the area they may try to find you again. Also make
                sure to include your name so that the driver can call out for you!

                Typically drivers are available in the evening from about 6pm through
                2am in the busier sections of downtown such as the North Loop, Warehouse,
                and Downtown West districts.
